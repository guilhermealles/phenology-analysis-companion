* Introduction

This is the companion repository for the paper entitled *Measuring
Phenology Uncertainty with Large Scale Image Processing*, by Guilherme
Rezende Alles, Jo√£o L. D. Comba, Jean-Marc Vincent, Shin Nagai, and
Lucas Mello Schnorr.

The code snippets presented in this repository are written in R, and
can be used to generate the figures from the paper. While some figures
are embedded with no extra manipulation, others are annotated with the
help of external tools to enrich the original paper's explanation.

The output from each of the R scripts is a pdf file with the
corresponding image.

** Clone this repository

The ~histograms~ directory in this repository contains the histograms
extracted from phenological images in the form of compressed CSV
files. There are 3 histogram files, and their sizes vary from ~210MB
to ~465MB

** Datasets

There are three datasets explored in the original paper, for which we
provide pre-processed histograms. The datasets are detailed in the
following table.
